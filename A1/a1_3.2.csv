"Based on the accuracies shown above, we can see that the value of the accuracy increases as the number of training samples increases. This makes sense since the smaller sample size of dataset is not able to emphasize the characteristics of each class, which could cause the misclassification. As the number of training samples increases, the characteristics of the each class would be highlighted and enhance the performance of the classification. Moreover, an increasing trend is expected and the value of accuracy is also expected to decrease at some point where the overfit occurs. The expected increasing trend is shown by the data collected. However, the expected decreasing trend is not displayed. The reason is that the sample size is still too small so that the overfit does not occur.",,,,
