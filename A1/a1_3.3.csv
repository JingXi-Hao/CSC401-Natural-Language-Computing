"Answer for (a): Based on the results for top k features selected, the features selected as top ones for smaller k are going to show again for using higher k. In addition, the features chosen at both low and high(er) amounts of input data are 29 (liwc_AllPunc), 35 (liwc_OtherP), 83 (liwc_motion), and 96 (liwc_relative). These language categories are able to show one's emotional and cognitive tendencies and mindset, which is able to expose their political persuasion. Hence, these language categories are able to express class characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Answer for (b): As you can see, the p-values for top features selected for 32K case are all zeros. But for 1K case, the p-values for top features selected are all small but non-zero.  According to the p-values generated by using 1K and 32K training samples, the p-values are generally lower given more data. Since the p-values for all features are getting lower given more data, therefore, all features contributes more on classification. This makes much sense because the accuracy gets higher when using more training samples as shown above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Answer for (c): The top 5 features chosen for 32K training case are 29 (liwc_AllPunc), 35 (liwc_OtherP), 64 (liwc_female), 83 (liwc_motion), and 96 (liwc_relative). The punctuation category is able to show one's emotion. Also, female, motion, and relative categories are able to show one's cognitive style and concepts. This helps to classify the political persuasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
